EC
==

EC is a public domain header-only software library designed to make coding in C and C++ easier for novice programmers with little or no prior programming experience. It is a library that I will keep updating as I keep updating the lesson plans for my students. This is public domain work, and anyone is welcome to use and contribute to this library.
